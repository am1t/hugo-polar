Hello 👋🏽, I am Amit Gawande

A software developer by profession and a writer by interest, I work at & live in Pune. I read mystery, humour and philosophy. I write words for humans and machines.

My love for blogging *started in early 2007*, though I was at my productive writing best during 2009-10. I am a technology enthusiast who likes to keep a tab on advances in the technology world.

I also have a passion [for writing fiction](/categories/fiction/); it allows me to kindle the creative part of my heart, which I tend to lock down, unintentionally, due to the hectic work-life.
