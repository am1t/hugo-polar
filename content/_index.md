Hello 👋🏽, I am Amit Gawande

A software developer by profession and a writer by interest, I work at & live in Pune. I read mystery, humour and philosophy. I write words for humans and machines with a passion [for writing fiction](/fiction/).

I professionally work building backend services, but I also love designing interfaces on web. I grew up as an introverted kid in a town in central part of India. 

A blog no more, this is my website. [I elaborate here](/colophon/).
